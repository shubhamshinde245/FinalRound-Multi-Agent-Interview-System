# Multi-Agent Interview System - Implementation Plan

## Overview
A LlamaIndex-based multi-agent system for conducting automated technical interviews with real-time evaluation and session management.

---

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Basic Agents (Foundation)

### 1.1 Project Setup
- [ ] Install LlamaIndex and required dependencies
- [ ] Create project directory structure
- [ ] Set up environment configuration (.env for OpenAI API)
- [ ] Initialize basic CLI framework

### 1.2 Core Components
- [ ] **Document Parser** (`core/document_parser.py`)
  - Parse job description and resume text files
  - Extract key requirements and candidate skills
  - Create structured data for agent consumption

- [ ] **Session Manager** (`core/session_manager.py`)
  - Session persistence using JSON
  - Auto-save functionality (every 30 seconds)
  - 15-minute timeout with warning system
  - Resume capability from checkpoints

### 1.3 Basic Agent Implementation
- [ ] **OrchestratorAgent** (`agents/orchestrator_agent.py`)
  - Shared state management
  - Agent coordination logic
  - Session lifecycle management
  - Basic workflow orchestration

- [ ] **InterviewerAgent** (`agents/interviewer_agent.py`)
  - Basic question generation from job requirements
  - Simple conversation flow
  - Question categorization (technical/behavioral/situational)

### 1.4 Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test document parsing with sample files
- [ ] Verify session persistence and timeout functionality
- [ ] Basic agent communication testing
- [ ] CLI basic functionality test

**Deliverables:** 
- Working project structure
- Basic interview session start/stop
- Simple question generation
- Session persistence

## Phase 2: Advanced Agent Logic & Real-time Evaluation

### 2.1 Enhanced Agent Development
- [ ] **TopicManagerAgent** (`agents/topic_manager_agent.py`)
  - Interview flow control and topic transitions
  - Coverage tracking of job requirements
  - Pacing and timing management
  - Adaptive interview progression

- [ ] **EvaluatorAgent** (`agents/evaluator_agent.py`)
  - Real-time response evaluation
  - Multi-criteria scoring system:
    - Technical knowledge assessment
    - Communication skills evaluation
    - Problem-solving approach analysis
  - Continuous feedback generation

### 2.2 Dynamic Question Generation
- [ ] Context-aware question generation
- [ ] Adaptive questioning based on candidate responses
- [ ] Follow-up question logic
- [ ] Difficulty adjustment based on performance

### 2.3 Agent Workflow Integration
- [ ] **Workflow Manager** (`agents/workflow.py`)
  - LlamaIndex AgentWorkflow implementation
  - Multi-agent coordination patterns
  - State transitions and handoffs
  - Error handling and recovery

### 2.4 Enhanced CLI Interface
- [ ] Rich terminal interface with progress indicators
- [ ] Real-time interview status display
- [ ] Interactive command system
- [ ] Warning notifications for timeouts

**Deliverables:**
- Complete 4-agent system
- Real-time evaluation during interview
- Dynamic question adaptation
- Polished CLI experience

## Phase 3: Output Generation & System Refinement

### 3.1 Interview Output System
- [ ] **Transcript Generation**
  - Timestamped conversation log
  - Speaker identification (Interviewer/Candidate)
  - Formatted output with session metadata
  - Save to `transcripts/` directory

- [ ] **Evaluation Report Generation**
  - Detailed scoring breakdown by criteria
  - Strengths and weaknesses analysis
  - Interview performance summary
  - Hiring recommendations
  - Save to `evaluations/` directory

### 3.2 System Optimization
- [ ] Performance optimization for agent interactions
- [ ] Memory management for long sessions
- [ ] Error handling and graceful degradation
- [ ] Logging and debugging improvements

### 3.3 Advanced Features
- [ ] Interview quality self-assessment
- [ ] Question effectiveness tracking
- [ ] Session analytics and metrics
- [ ] Resume-job description matching scores

### 3.4 Final Testing & Documentation
- [ ] End-to-end system testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] User documentation
- [ ] Code documentation and comments
- [ ] Sample interview demonstrations

**Deliverables:**
- Complete interview system with full output generation
- Comprehensive transcript and evaluation files
- Production-ready system with error handling
- Full documentation and examples

## Technical Architecture Summary

### Agent Communication Pattern
```
OrchestratorAgent (Central Coordinator)
    ├── InterviewerAgent (Question Generation)
    ├── TopicManagerAgent (Flow Control)  
    └── EvaluatorAgent (Real-time Assessment)
```

### Data Flow
1. **Input**: Resume + Job Description → Document Parser
2. **Session**: OrchestratorAgent → Initialize shared state
3. **Interview Loop**: 
   - TopicManagerAgent → Determine next topic
   - InterviewerAgent → Generate question
   - Candidate → Provides response
   - EvaluatorAgent → Assess response
   - Repeat until completion/timeout
4. **Output**: Generate transcript + evaluation files
